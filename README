### Testing

We use Ripple, which is a hybrid app emulator, and will support many of the features that we use in each device. However it wount replace testing in a device.

To start ripple, start chrome with --disable-web-security 
	open  /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --allow-file-access-from-files --disable-web-security

1. Install the ripple extention
2. Open a new incognito window, and right click and enable ripple.
3. Then brows to the /assets/www/js/tests.html 
4. And select phonegap
5. make sure that the "Cross Domain Proxy" is set to disabled. 

! There is a problem with the newest version of Google Chrome, Mac and the winktoolkit, if you want to test inside the browser, you have to install an older version !

Use http://mac.oldapps.com/google_chrome.php and version 16.0.912.63 (5 month ago)
